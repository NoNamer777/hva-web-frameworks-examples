# Degrees of Engagement Diagram Example

This example was built for EWA and Blockchain students that are part of the Degrees of Engagement (DoE) project at AUAS (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences)

The main objective of this diagram is showing project members, within their categories (e.g. environment, society) and engagement levels (e.g. core, partner). Here, an example of the output:

This project uses the [D3js library](https://d3js.org/), and it was based on the TechRadar example available [here](https://codepen.io/douglaseggleton/pen/YYBWvp)
 
The code is written in Typescript but can be easily ported to Javascript. Thank you, Douglas Eggleton, for this great didactic example!
