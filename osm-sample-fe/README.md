## OpenLayers Introductory Example

This project aims at showing how to use the OpenLayers API to render and manage OpenStreetMaps components.

## Background information:

This simple example shows a component that renders the map of Amsterdam, allowing :
- moving between two HvA campi.
- users find addresses in the map using the nominatim API
- diplay the borders of each neighboorhood of Amsterdam by using a GeoJSON provided by the Gemeente of Amsterdam

## Running the project

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
